# User interface

## Timeline view

The timeline view displays your media library with items grouped by day. It is possible to search and filter by rating via the UI. The view also accepts query params for filtering that are not yet available via the UI.

## Memories

If media items exist "on this day" from year(s) ago, they will be displayed at the top of the timeline. The memories UI can be dismissed for the day, which is persisted via the browser's local storage.

Click the "X days ago" to scroll to that date on the timeline.
